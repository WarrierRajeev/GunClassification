# GunClassification

Created a Dataset by downloading images of three most popular handguns namely Glock, revolver and the desert eagle. Used the Fastai Library to create a CNN from a pretrained Resnet-34 (Transfer Learning).

glock.txt, revolver.txt and desert_eagle.txt are text files containing the urls of images that are to be downloaded.
